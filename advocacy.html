            <p>
                As someone who actively joins mission trips, I’ve seen how meaningful change begins with <b>compassion
                    and
                    connection</b>. These experiences have inspired me to extend my mission beyond physical outreach and
                into
                the digital world. My advocacy focuses on <b>promoting digital literacy</b>,
                especially among students and young people in underprivileged communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                In many places I’ve visited, access to technology is growing, but awareness of how to use it safely and
                effectively remains limited. Through workshops, mentorship, and online campaigns, I aim to teach
                practical digital skills, online safety, and ethical use of technology. I believe that by educating
                others on how to use digital tools wisely, we can open doors to new learning opportunities and <b>empower
                    individuals</b> to become responsible digital citizens.
            </p>
            <p>
                By combining my passion for service with technology, I hope to <b>bridge the gap</b> between communities and
                the digital world. This advocacy is not just about teaching skills—it’s about inspiring people to use
                technology as a means to uplift others, strengthen communities, and continue the spirit of mission work
                in a modern, connected way.

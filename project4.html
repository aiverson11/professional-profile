            <p class="portfolio-intro">The Personalized Learning Content Recommender is an AI-driven platform designed to enhance learning experiences by providing tailored educational resources to users. It creates individual learner profiles by collecting data on preferences, learning goals, performance, and interaction history. Based on this data, the system uses advanced recommendation algorithms to suggest articles, videos, tutorials, or exercises that are most relevant to the user’s needs.</p>
            <p class="portfolio-intro">The system includes explainable AI insights that clarify why a particular resource is recommended, helping learners understand and trust the suggestions. It tracks user progress, identifies weak areas, and adapts recommendations over time to support continuous learning. With multi-platform access, content categorization, feedback mechanisms, and notification features, the Personalized Learning Content Recommender serves as a dynamic and interactive learning companion that promotes self-directed and effective education.</p>

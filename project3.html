            <h1 class="heading">AI-Powered Resume Analyzer</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-intro">The AI-Powered Resume Analyzer is a sophisticated system designed to help job
                seekers optimize their resumes and improve their chances of employment. It utilizes natural language
                processing (NLP) to parse resumes, extract critical information such as skills, education, work
                experience, and achievements, and then evaluates them against industry standards and job-specific
                requirements.</p>
            <p class="portfolio-intro">The system provides a scoring mechanism to identify strengths and weaknesses in
                the resume, highlights missing skills relevant to the desired role, and offers actionable suggestions
                for improving clarity, formatting, and keyword usage. Additionally, it can generate visual summaries in
                charts or infographics, allowing users to quickly assess their resume profile. With job-matching
                features and exportable feedback reports, the AI-Powered Resume Analyzer helps users strategically
                improve their resumes while maintaining data privacy and supporting continuous progress tracking.</p>

            <p class="portfolio-intro">The AI Chatbot System Software is a web-based intelligent system designed to interact with users in natural language, providing accurate and context-aware responses. This system integrates Explainable AI (XAI) visualizations to enhance user trust by showing the reasoning behind each AI-generated answer. Using the LIME algorithm, it highlights key parts of the user input that influenced the response, allowing users to understand the AI’s decision-making process.</p>
            <p class="portfolio-intro">The system includes pre-test and post-test survey functionality to assess user trust in AI, with metrics based on the three-dimensional trust framework (ability, integrity, and benevolence). Users can easily interact with the chatbot through a clean and responsive interface on both web and mobile devices. The system also collects feedback, logs user interactions for research, and provides personalized responses, ensuring continuous improvement. By combining conversational AI, explainability, and trust measurement, this software serves as a tool for both user engagement and academic research in AI explainability.</p>

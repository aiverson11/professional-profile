            <h1 class="heading">Smart Campus Navigator</h1>
            <p class="portfolio-intro">The Smart Campus Navigator is an intelligent navigation system designed to assist
                students, staff, and visitors in efficiently navigating a campus environment. It combines interactive
                maps, real-time location tracking, and predictive analytics to provide the best routes for users while
                considering factors such as building locations, crowd density, and accessibility needs.</p>
            <p class="portfolio-intro">The system features integration with campus events and schedules, allowing users
                to receive timely updates about ongoing classes, events, or facility availability. A conversational AI
                interface allows users to ask questions about locations or services, and the system provides clear
                guidance and directions. By incorporating accessibility features such as wheelchair-accessible route
                planning, it ensures inclusivity for all users. The Smart Campus Navigator simplifies campus navigation,
                reduces congestion, and provides personalized routing, making it an indispensable tool for improving
                campus experiences and efficiency.</p>
